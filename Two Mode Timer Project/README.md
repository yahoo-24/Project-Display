# Two Mode Timer
## Introduction
This is a project to make a timer using Intel Quartus and verifying the modules using ModelSim Altera. The goal of the project is to build a timer that can count both upwards (stopwatch) up to 99.99 seconds and downwards (timer) from any minute between 8.00 and 1.00. Another objective was to make the project using only structural logic (apart from D Flip Flops). The challenge was to make the timer strictly using the structure below.
